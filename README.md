## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I can not get any images to show up on my page. It is a current problem and I have no idea why they are not showing up.
I am also struggling to make the webpage responsive. I could not get div's to flex properly so I switched to a table in 
order to show the cards.
